# BrockChatbot


The project is described as a web-based dialogue centered application capable of receiving
either text or speech input, processing it and generating text output. It is to be a stand-alone
piece of software with a mono-directional dependency on the Gems Pro statistical resource
provided by Canada Games. Furthermore, it uses AI to assist in natural language processing
from user inputs. The processed inputs are then used to query the internal database which live
scrapes from Gem Pro statistics. These query results are returned to the user to provide
information services. Services include finding athlete information, event information, track record
and history, transportation routes, ticketing purchasing resources, etc.
